Beyond the Bubble

Our application is simple. When it is run on the Oculus, you will be brought to our main menu. There are two options selectable via the trigger button:
Start Game begins the game component.
Quit Game ends the game and exits the application.

When Start Game is pressed, the user is taken to a Map Scene where the user can select one of three different stars on the map to begin one of the main scenes.

Each main scene flows the same:

The user is presented with text prompts to the right, and can use the trigger to select buttons on the right hand to respond to the prompt, each given by the user's friend Robin. 
The player either loses or wins the situation based on how they respond to the prompt and how appropriate it is. Upon loss or win, indicated by red or green text respectively, 
is brought back to the map scene to continue the gameplay loop.
